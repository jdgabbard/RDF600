# RDF-600
 RDF-600 Floppy Adapter for MSX Computers.

***Based on the TDC-600***

![PCB](https://github.com/jdgabbard/RDF600/blob/372d3db0e5000d987bccad0d56246c0004164e6b/Photos/RDF600.jpg)

This is a clone of the TDC-600 Disk Adadpter for MSX Computers redesigned for a more compact footprint.  This should fit inside standard MSX cartridge shells that have been modified to allow for the floppy ribbon cable.

The board is compatible with the standard TDC-600 firmware.  Or, if using an imported machine in the US or UK, it can be used with the provided firmware which has been patched for the English Language.
